Week 3 Overview

This week we will complete our introduction to R.  We will focus on 
the following concepts:

	1.  Graphics in R

	2.  Oral presentations

R for Everyone:

	Chapter 7, "Statistical Graphics"
	More on Graphics for Exploratory Data Analysis:

	“Basics of Histograms,”

	“Box-plot with R – Tutorial,”

	“Scatterplots,”

	My current favorite book on R and Graphics is Winston Chang's R
	Graphics Cookbook.  This book focuses primarily on using the ggplot2
	package

	This ungraded Week 3 quiz is intended as a hands-on-lab to help you build your skills writing R code to generate descriptive statistics and basic graphics.  Solutions to all problems are immediately available, but you’ll learn the material more durably if you attempt each problem before consulting its solution. 

	Load the diamonds dataset, which is included with the ggplot2 package.  Identify which variables in the diamond set are numeric, and which are categorical (factors).
	
	Generate summary level descriptive statistics: 
	Show the mean, median, 25th and 75th quartiles, min, and max for
	each of the applicable variables in diamonds.
	
	Determine the frequency for each of the diamond colors.
	
	Determine the frequency for each of the diamond cuts, by color
	
	Create a graph for a single numeric variable.
	
	Create a scatterplot of two numeric variables.
	
	The R Markdown file with the solution code is attached.

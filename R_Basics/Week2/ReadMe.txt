Core reading:
Please read the following material in R for Everyone:  Chapter 11-13

Students that are ready for a more advanced treatment of manipulating dates and strings may also find helpful Gaston Sanchez's freely downloadable eBook on Handling and Processing Strings in R  here: http://gastonsanchez.com/Handling_and_Processing_Strings_in_R.pdf





Optional Reading

	For students with more programming background or some previous
	experience with R, you may find interesting the material in Hadley
	Wickham's book, Advanced R
	(available on-line here: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/). 
	The material in chapter 2 ("Data Structures") and chapter 3
	("subsetting") map roughly to this week's material.  
	Another book aimed for developers (not freely available on-line)
	is Norman Matloff's The Art of R Programming.
